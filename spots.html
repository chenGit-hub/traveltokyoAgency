A symbol of Japan's post-war rebirth as a major economic power, Tokyo Tower was the country's tallest structure from its completion in 1958 until 2012 when it was surpassed by the Tokyo Skytree. In addition to being a popular tourist spot, Tokyo Tower serves as a broadcast antenna. Source: japan-guide.com</p>

It has in fact been the commercial center of the country for centuries and is where five ancient roads connecting Japan's major cities all met. Lined by exclusive shops and imposing palatial stores, the Ginza district is also fun to simply wander around or. Better still, sit in one of its many tea and coffee shops or restaurants while watching the world rush past. Source: planetware.com</p>

It also happens to be one of the best spots in Tokyo to view the cherry blossoms, as the garden has roughly 1,500 cherry trees. You'll also find Himalayan cedars, cypresses, and tulip trees. The garden is very popular in the autumn, when the leaves start to change to crimson and gold. Source: planetware.com</p>

The theater's interior, usually full to capacity with some 2,000 guests, is always intimate and seems more akin to an enormous family get-together than a stage show due to the fact that spectators bring their own food or purchase treats from the various restaurants spread around the auditorium (go for one of the tasty bento box meals).
